 # SQL
 
 Project Name| Description|Concepts Used
 ------------|------------|------------
:house:[Data Cleaning on Nashville Housing Data](https://github.com/MubeenaHussain/SQL--1/blob/main/README.md)| Worked on the Consistency, Uniqueness, Completeness, Relevancy of the Data. Divided a single column containing multiple pieces of information into multiple columns to make it more useful.|Case Statements, CTEs, Finding Duplicates using ROW_NUMBER, Self Joins, Functions like SUBSTRING, CHARINDEX, PARSENAME and REPLACE. | 
:spaghetti: [Danny's Diner](https://github.com/MubeenaHussain/SQL-CASE-STUDY/blob/main/README.md)|Case Study of a small restaurant in which I answer questions about its customers, their visiting patterns, amount of money they've spent and their favorite menu items. These answers will help the venture deliver a better and more personalized experience to their loyal customers  | Aggregations, Window Functions, Joins, CTEs, Case Statements, and Subqueries   |
:pizza: [Pizza Runner](https://github.com/MubeenaHussain/SQL-Case-study-2/blob/main/README.md)| Case study of a Zomato-like startup where I answer questions related to Pizza Metrics, Runner & Customer Experience, Ingredient Optimisation, and Pricing and Ratings so that the venture can better direct its runners and optimize operations. Also, a significant focus on handling data quality issues.    | Data Type Conversion, Temporary tables, Aggregations, Case Statements, CTEs, Joins, DATE functions like DATEDIFF, DATEPART & DATEADD, Table-valued functions, CROSS APPLY, String Manipulation Functions like STRING_SPLIT, STRING_AGG plus WITHIN GROUP clause & CONCAT_WS   |
:ramen: [Foodie Fi](https://github.com/MubeenaHussain/SQL-CASE-STUDY-3/blob/main/README.md)| This case study is about a Netflix-type startup but only with cooking shows. The idea is to use the data of this subscription-based digital business to understand its customers' journey and behavior on the platform to make data-driven decisions regarding future investments and new features.   |  Aggregations, Joins, Case Statements, CTEs, Window functions like LAG & LEAD, Data Type Conversions to obtain correct percentages & averages, CONCAT to obtain desired string format |
:money_with_wings: [Data Bank](https://github.com/MubeenaHussain/4.SQL-/blob/main/README.md)| Case study of an initiative that combines banking and cloud data storage. Focuses on exploring how this unique model works, how the business is doing, and using data to forecast for future data storage requirements and developments   | Aggregations, Percentile calculation using PERCENTILE_DISC, Case Statements with SUM, using SUM as Window function to calculate running total, CTEs, Joins  |
:convenience_store: [Data Mart](https://github.com/MubeenaHussain/5.SQL/blob/main/README.md)| An online supermarket that specializes in fresh produce has recently made a significant change in its packaging methods. The goal is to analyze sales performance over the years and quantify the impact of the big change on its performance and specific business areas. A good example of `Before & After` Analysis   | Data Transformation, Case Statements, CTEs, Sum with Case Statements, ADD AS clause, Before & After Analysis and functions like FORMAT, DATEPART     |

 ------------|------------|------------|-----------
 :oncoming_automobile: [US Car Accidents Analysis](https://github.com/MubeenaHussain/python-1/blob/main/US_Car_Accidents_Jupyter_Notebook.ipynb)| Data Cleaning & EDA   | Analyzing **2.8 million** records of Car Accidents in 49 states of America to find trends, patterns and anomalies in the cities where these accidents happened, their timings, monthly and yearly trends, and severity. Also, I try to test this hypothesis - *'Are Car Accidents More Likely to Occur during the Winters?'*   | *pandas, matplotlib, seaborn*  |
 :snowflake: [Scraping GitHub](\) | Web Scraping | Scraping the *topics* page of GitHub and creating a list of top repositories for each topic   | *requests, beautifulsoup, and pandas* |
